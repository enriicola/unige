## Sensors we plan to use:

- [x] External Temperature
- [x] External humidity
- [x] Soil moisture (to show that our system keeps the moisture stable w.r.t. the external humidity)
- [x] Light sensor to protect a specific plant from too much light and to alert the user if the plant is not receiving enough light
- [ ] Ph soil sensor (to alert the user if the soil is too acidic or too basic w.r.t. the specific plant's needs)
- [x] Water tank level (to check if the user needs to refill it)

## Features we plan to implement:

- [x] Automatic watering system
- [ ] Dashboard GUI system to alert low level of the water tank
- [ ] Notifications to the user if the plant needs more light
- [x] Automatic mini-roof to protect the plant from too much light
